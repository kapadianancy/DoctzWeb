                                                                                   </p>
                                                                            <p>
                                                                                <h4>  1st Tip - Eat Right  </h4>
Choose the right foods and plan a healthy, balanced meal. Include whole grains, fruits, fresh vegetables and dry fruits that can keep you energized throughout the day. Choose lean meat, fish, eggs and pulses for a protein boost to keep you strong. Avoid junk food and processed meals as they can invite health problems and allergies.
                                                                            </p>
										
                                                                            <p>
                                                                                <h4>2nd Tip - Stay Hydrated </h4>

Staying hydrated is essential for every season, be it summer, winter or monsoon. You may not realize the need to have water when the climate is cold, but it still is very important. Drink plenty of water; it can help you get rid of toxins and stay healthy. You can choose fresh fruit juices, coconut water or warm drinks like green tea, soups and curries.

                                                                            </p>
                                                                            
                                                                            <p>
                                                                                <h4>3rd Tip - Exercise Every day </h4>
Exercise not only improves blood circulation but also keeps your stress levels low. It helps to keep the joints supple and strong, thus reducing the chances of muscle and joint problems with climate change. Regular exercises improve oxygenation and immunity, thus keeping allergies and infections at bay. Simple walking or swimming can help or you can even practice yoga under the supervision of an expert.

                                                                            </p>
                                                                            
                                                                            <p>
                                                                                <h4>4th Tip - Sleep Well </h4>

Adequate rest and sleep allow your body and mind to heal, which helps to fight illnesses. Climate change can be stressful causing fatigue and a feeling of being unwell. Sleeping well during the night and taking rest, as required can help you deal with your health problems during changing climate. 
                                                                            </p>
                                                                            
                                                                            <p>
                                                                                <h4>5th Tip - Follow Medical Advice </h4>

The last but not the least; seek medical opinion for your health problems. Follow your doctorâ€™s advice and take your routine medications, if any, as prescribed. Whether it is medication, vaccination or diet and lifestyle advice, follow it religiously and talk to your doctor, for any concerns.
                                                                            </p>
